	<p>
	The Weimaraner originated in the early 19th century in Germany, where it was conscientiously developed and bred to maintain its physical and mental characteristics, and jealously guarded. The ideal dog was one that possessed courage, speed, intelligence and a well-developed scenting ability. The breed was originally used for big game, but was later adapted to use as a bird dog; and was found to be a good pointer and retriever. The Weimaraner was first recognized by the AKC in 1943. Some of its talents include: hunting, tracking, retrieving, pointing, watchdog, guarding, police work, service for the disabled, search and rescue and agility.
